# CPSC 491 Project - Memoize
## Web Application Project

### Summary
This web application utilizes state- of-the-art AI technology to create content for games using user-generated note cards. The app allows users to create note cards for memorization, which will be used as inputs to the game engine. Game layout will be at the center of the application. Users will nagivate in a game map to segue between tabs and functionality that the app offers.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
